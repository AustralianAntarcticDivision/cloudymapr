CCAMLR GIS

Statistical areas, subareas and divisions are used globally for the purpose of reporting fishery statistics. CCAMLR's Convention Area in the Southern Ocean is divided, for statistical purposes, into Area 48 (Atlantic Antarctic) between 70oW and 30oE, Area 58 (Indian Ocean Antarctic) between 30oE and 150oE, and Area 88 (Pacific Antarctic) between 150oE and 70oW. These areas, which are further subdivided into subareas and divisions, are managed by CCAMLR. A global register of statistical areas, subareas and divisions is maintained by FAO http://www.fao.org/fishery/area/search/en. CCAMLR Secretariat (2013)
