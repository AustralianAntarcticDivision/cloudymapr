# cloudymapr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of cloudymapr is to provide cloud-oriented mapping functionality for R. In particular, it aims to provide a leaflet-like interactive map that works better with modern cloud-oriented file formats (COGs and similar), and makes use of recent developments in GDAL for fast data access and rendering.

Everything is entirely experimental at this stage.

## Installation

You can install the development version of cloudymapr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("AustralianAntarcticDivision/cloudymapr")

```

## Demo

Try:

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
library(cloudymapr)
vl_demo()

```
